Simluation about supply depot.
The UBSD (University of Bordeaux Supply Depot) team will focus on developing a stationary module that would receive mined resources and serve as a logistics hub on the moon. 
And lunar rovers can store or obtain certain resources via this module.
More specifically, resources can be water, oxygen and fuel. 
We divide our development process into two main aspects: 
1. Interaction with federates developed by other teams; 
2. Physics and logic that generates the data exchanged among federates.
